Analyzed data should be stored in the Data folder in a subfolder called Analyzed, such that the data is found in
Project/Data/Analyzed
NOTE: Downloading the analyzed data allows you to stick running Data.py and DBSCAN.py to preprocess the raw data.  These scripts take six hours to run, so it is recommended to download the analyzed data.
